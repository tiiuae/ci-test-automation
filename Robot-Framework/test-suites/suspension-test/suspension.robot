*** Test Cases ***

Automatic suspension
    [Documentation]   Wait and check that
    ...               in the beginning brightness is 96000
    ...               in 4 min - the screen dims (brightness is 24000)
    ...               in 5 min - the screen locks (brightness is 24000)
    ...               in 7,5 min - screen turns off
    ...               in 15 min - the laptop is suspended
    ...               in 5 min press the button and check that laptop woke up

    [Setup]           Test setup

    Check the screen state   on
    Check screen brightness  ${max_brightness}

    Start power measurement       ${BUILD_ID}   timeout=1500

    Connect to VM    ${GUI_VM}  ${USER_LOGIN}  ${USER_PASSWORD}
    Set start timestamp

    Wait     240
    Check screen brightness  ${dimmed_brightness}

    Wait     10

    IF  $COMPOSITOR != 'cosmic'   Check notification   The system will suspend soon due to inactivity.    ${last_id}
