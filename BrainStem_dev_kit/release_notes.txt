BrainStem2® Support Package Release
===============================================================================

The BrainStem Release 2.9
===============================================================================

The BrainStem 2.9.0 release debuts Acroname's new USBHub3c module. This module
brings in 3x new entities: Power Delivery, Port and USBSystem. More information
on these entities can be found in the online reference guide.

In most cases users will not be affected by the changes in the 2.9.x release with
a few exceptions listed below; however, it is always recommend to match the Major
and Minor of firmware to software. (2.9.0 -> Major.Minor.Patch)

C++ namespace adjustments - Module headers now use full namespaces instead of the
"using" directive.  This change keeps the namespace cleaner but may require
users to use full namespaces when using functions that do not belong to a 
module object.

Removed deprecated calls that were defined in the 2.8.x release.
  - Temperature::getTemperature -> Temperature::getValue
  - Rail::setVoltage -> Rail::setVoltageSetpoint

Drivers
===============================================================================

Since release 2.2, BrainStem users no longer need to install drivers on any of our
supported platforms. Windows 7 users will still need to Update the device driver
software for their BrainStem devices, via the BrainStem.inf file that we provide.


Additional Libraries (Linux users only)
===============================================================================

The StemTool distribution for linux now uses the libicu52 library in an effort to
increase legacy support.  Newer versions of Linux (such as Ubuntu 16.04) may require
the installation of this library.  It can be found on Ubuntu's website.
