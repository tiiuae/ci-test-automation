mtm_io_serial_uart.py
========================

General Overview:
-----------------
This example is a basic demonstration of the MTM-Load-1's Constant Current ability. In this example the Rail 0 entity is being initialized, setup for constant current linear operation with a current setpoint of 100mA. After which, there is modification of the max voltage limit to 5V and enabling of the rail. While the rail is enabled, the measured voltage and current is gathered, then the rail is diabled.

How to Run:
-----------
To run this example follow the instructions enumerated in the BrainStem python documentation.
