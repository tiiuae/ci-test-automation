mtm_io_serial_uart.py
========================

General Overview:
-----------------
This example is a basic demonstration of the MTMIOSerial's communication capabilities. In this example a line of communication is open between the user's computer and the MTMIOSerial. This line of communication is a loopback such that the MTMIOSerial receives bytes from the computer and then immediately sends them back to the computer. At the end of this example a read out of the number of bytes sent from the computer and a read out of the data read in by the computer is presented to the user.

How to Run:
-----------
To run this example follow the instructions enumerated in the BrainStem python documentation.
