BrainStem2 C++ Example Readme
===============================================================================

This is a basic C++ example using the 40-pin USBStem Module. When run, this
example demonstrates reading the input voltage, flashing the user LED, reading
the analog and digital inputs and writing data to I2C.

Notes:
===============================================================================

# To build, copy the lib directory into this directory. The lib directory contains
    the required header files, and the Brainstem2 shared object file.

# The output directory is linux_BrainStem2Example/Debug.

# A build step has been added to the project that copies the shared object into 
    the build output directory. In addition the runpath is updated to search in
    the same directory as the executable.
