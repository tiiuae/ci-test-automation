BrainStem2 C++ Example Readme
===============================================================================

This is an example for the BrainStem 2.0 library to show different ways to connect
to BrainStem devices. When run, the executable will connect to user specified 
devices (as determined by the c++ code.)

Notes:
===============================================================================

# To build, copy the lib directory into this directory. The lib directory contains
    the required header files, and the Brainstem2 shared object file.

# The output directory is linux_BrainStem2Example/Debug.

# A build step has been added to the project that copies the shared object into 
    the build output directory. In addition the runpath is updated to search in
    the same directory as the executable.
