USBHub CMD Line Example
===============================================================================

This is a basic CMD line example that was designed for the USBHub2x4, USBHub3p
and USBHub3c but could easily be adapted to our other products.  It depends on
an external header implementation "cxxopts.h".  The source for this file can be
found at: https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts.

Example execution:
-h            //Prints the help information.
-p 0 -e 0     //Disables port 0
-p 0 -e 1     //Enables port 0
-p 0 -e 0 -b  //Disables just the data lines of port 0
-p 0 -e 0 -a  //Disables just the power lines of port 0

Notes:
===============================================================================

# To build, copy the lib directory into this directory. The lib directory contains
    the required header files, and the Brainstem2 shared object file.

# The makefile is setup with 3x different configurations.
    - Debug - Linked to the libBrainStem2.so
        * make debug
    - Release - Linked to the libBrainStem2.so
        * make release
    - Static - Linked to libBrainStem2.a for easy deployment. 
        * make static

# For Debug and Release configurations the shared object is copied into the 
  output folder. The shared object must be next to the executable or install
  into the local system.
