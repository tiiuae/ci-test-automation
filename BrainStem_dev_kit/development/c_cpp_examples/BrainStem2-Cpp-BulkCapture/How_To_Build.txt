BrainStem2 A2D Bulk Capture C++ Example Readme
===============================================================================

This is a C++ example for the BrainStem 2.0 library to demonstrate bulk capturing 
A2D readings. When run, the module triggers a bulk reading on analog input 0,
retrieves the values from the RAM store slot and pipes the readings to STDOUT.

Notes:
===============================================================================

# To build, copy the lib directory into this directory. The lib directory contains
    the required header files, and the Brainstem2 shared object file.

# The output directory is linux_Brainstem2A2DBulkCapture/Debug.

# A build step has been added to the project that copies the shared object into 
    the build output directory. In addition the runpath is updated to search in
    the same directory as the executable.
