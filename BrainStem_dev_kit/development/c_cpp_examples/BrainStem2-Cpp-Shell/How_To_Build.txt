BrainStem2 C++ Empty Example Readme
===============================================================================

This is a empty C++ example for the BrainStem 2.0 library. The example has 
the necessary includes for communicating with BrainStem modules.

Notes:
===============================================================================

# To build, copy the lib directory into this directory. The lib directory contains
    the required header files, and the Brainstem2 shared object file.

# The output directory is linux_BrainStem2Shell/Debug.

# A build step has been added to the project that copies the shared object into 
    the build output directory. In addition the runpath is updated to search in
    the same directory as the executable.
